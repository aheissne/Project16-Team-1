# Project16-Team-1
AI Powered GRE Vocabulary Tool

The team is developing an AI-powered GRE vocabulary learning tool that integrates with an existing Flask API providing reinforcement-learning-based hints.
The current focus is on building the front-end locally using HTML/CSS/JavaScript (or React), guided by initial wireframes and a mobile-first design approach.
The team is testing mock data to simulate vocabulary words while setting up the core structure and navigation of the application.  

Project Overview 

The AI-Powered GRE Vocabulary Tool is designed to enhance an existing vocabulary-learning application that supports students preparing for the GRE. 
The current tool already leverages a reinforcement learning (RL) model to provide personalized hints based on learner performance.
Our project builds on this foundation by improving the user interface, expanding multimedia features, and integrating gamification to create a more engaging and effective study experience. 
This project is important because vocabulary mastery is a critical component of GRE success, yet many study tools fail to adapt to diverse learner needs.
By introducing audio pronunciations, curated multimedia hints, and mobile-first responsive design, our solution will provide learners with a more accessible and interactive way to strengthen vocabulary retention. 
For the sponsor, this project delivers significant value by extending the functionality and usability of a working product that has already reached over 100 learners.
Enhancements to UI/UX, gamification, and integration with scalable APIs will make the tool more attractive to a broader audience, while also demonstrating the sponsor’s reinforcement learning engine in a practical, real-world application. Ultimately, the project increases the tool’s potential for growth, adoption, and long-term impact in the education technology space.
